package main

// This is a file with package main inside the folder of the `shadow` package.
// It should no be included when `shadow` is imported.
// As shadowing_test.bt implicitly also has `package main` and contains a `spam()` function,
// this test would fail with a function redefinition error in case of improper handling.
