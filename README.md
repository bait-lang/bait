## Introduction
This repository contains the compiler, cli, standard library and documentation for Bait.

```bait
fun main() {
    println('hello world')
}
```


## Key Features
> **Status:** Bait is in active development.
> It is stable for personal use,
> but please be prepared for possible breaking changes and evolving features (ðŸš§).

- Consistent syntax balancing simplicity for newcomers with power for experienced developers
- Type and memory safety with immutability by default
- Explicit and predictable error handling using Result types
- JavaScript backend (NodeJS, ðŸš§ Web)
- ðŸš§ C backend
- Cross-platform support (Linux, ðŸš§ Windows)


## Documentation
> A dedicated website, comprehensive language documentation and a documentation generator are work in progress.<br>
> The language specification will be formalized and released during the beta phase.

The [Language Overview](docs/docs.md) provides a brief introduction to the syntax and features.


## Examples
Some basic example programs can be found in the [examples](examples) directory.

For a much larger list of examples, check out the [Rosetta Code solutions][rosetta].


## Installation
Right now Bait has to be compiled from source.
Precompiled binaries will be available in the future.


## Building from source
> Required dependencies: `git` and `NodeJS >= 18`

Linux:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/bait-lang/bait
cd bait
./make.sh
sudo ./bait symlink
```

Windows:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/bait-lang/bait
cd bait
./make.bat

# In admin shell:
./bait.bat symlink
```

Now you should have Bait compiled to JS at `<repo>/bait.js`.

Thanks to the symlinked wrapper script,
you can use the compiler with a simple command like `bait run examples/hello_world.bt`.


### Upgrading to the latest version
To update Bait to the latest commit, run `bait up`.
